## Question
How should i design a version control system for postgres where I like to store insert, update and delete operations on a given number of tables - like to have the sql code and data model for that


## Answer


Designing a version control system for PostgreSQL to track insert, update, and delete operations on a selected set of tables is a great way to maintain a historical record of your database changes. This can be useful for auditing purposes, analyzing historical data, or even recovering from unintended data modifications.

Below, I'll outline a basic approach to implement such a system using triggers and a history table. This example will include the SQL code needed to set up the system and a simple data model to get you started.

### 1\. Data Model for History Table

The history table should capture key details about each database operation, such as the operation type, the time it occurred, the data before and after the operation, and which table was affected. Here's a simple schema for a history table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE history (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    table_name VARCHAR(255),
    operation_type VARCHAR(10), -- 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE'
    old_data JSONB,
    new_data JSONB,
    operation_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

```

### 2\. Trigger Functions

You'll need to create trigger functions to log the changes into the history table. Here are generic SQL functions for handling inserts, updates, and deletes:

#### Trigger for INSERT

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_insert()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO history(table_name, operation_type, new_data)
    VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, 'INSERT', row_to_json(NEW));
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Trigger for UPDATE

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_update()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO history(table_name, operation_type, old_data, new_data)
    VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, 'UPDATE', row_to_json(OLD), row_to_json(NEW));
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

```

#### Trigger for DELETE

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_delete()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO history(table_name, operation_type, old_data)
    VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, 'DELETE', row_to_json(OLD));
    RETURN OLD;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

```

### 3\. Attaching Triggers to Tables

Once the functions are in place, you attach triggers to the tables you want to monitor. Here’s how you can do it:

```sql
-- Replace 'your_table_name' with the name of the table you want to monitor
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_after_insert
AFTER INSERT ON your_table_name
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE log_insert();

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_after_update
AFTER UPDATE ON your_table_name
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE log_update();

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_after_delete
AFTER DELETE ON your_table_name
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE log_delete();

```

### Considerations

1.  **Performance Impact**: Triggers can slow down data modification operations since they add overhead to each transaction.
2.  **Storage Requirements**: Storing a history of all changes can significantly increase your database size. You might need strategies to periodically archive old history data or purge it.
3.  **Security and Privacy**: Make sure that the history data is protected, especially if it contains sensitive information.

This setup should provide a good starting point for implementing a version control system in PostgreSQL. You can customize the history table and the triggers according to your specific requirements.
